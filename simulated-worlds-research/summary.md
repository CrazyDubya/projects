# Simulated Worlds for LLMs and AI

This document provides a summary of resources and information on the topic of "simulated worlds for LLMs and AI". It is organized into several sections, including key concepts, academic papers, simulators, software frameworks, books, and prompts.

## Key Concepts

*   **Simulated Worlds:** These are also known as artificial or virtual environments. They are created to model and study complex systems. For AI and LLMs, these worlds serve as a sandbox for training, testing, and developing agents.
*   **AI Agents:** These are autonomous entities that perceive their environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators. In simulated worlds, AI agents can learn and make decisions without real-world consequences.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** These are a type of AI that can understand and generate human-like text. In simulated worlds, LLMs can be used to create more realistic and dynamic non-player characters (NPCs), generate quests and dialogues, and even help in the creation of the world itself.
*   **Theory of Mind (ToM):** This is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc.—to oneself and to others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own. In the context of LLMs, ToM is crucial for creating believable agents in simulated worlds.

## Academic Papers

*   **From Words To Worlds: Enhancing Simulations With LLMs:** This paper explores the potential of integrating LLMs with simulations to improve realism, user experience, and analytical capabilities.

*   **The rise and potential of large language model based agents: a survey:** This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of AI agents based on LLMs.
    *   **Link:** The search result mentioned this paper but did not provide a direct link. A search for the title should provide the paper.

## Simulators

*   **Unity:** A popular game engine that is also widely used for creating simulations for AI research. It has a rich set of tools for creating complex 3D environments and a strong community.
*   **Unreal Engine:** Another powerful game engine that is used for creating high-fidelity simulations. It is known for its stunning graphics and realistic physics.
*   **CARLA:** An open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. It provides a realistic urban environment, a variety of sensors, and a flexible API for controlling agents.
*   **AI2-THOR:** A platform for embodied AI research. It provides a set of interactive environments where agents can learn to perform tasks by interacting with objects.

## Software Frameworks

*   **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is widely used for training and deploying deep learning models.
*   **PyTorch:** Another popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use.
*   **Hugging Face:** A company and an open-source platform that provides a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing (NLP).

## Books

*   **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig: This is a classic textbook on AI that covers a wide range of topics, including intelligent agents, problem-solving, knowledge representation, and machine learning.
*   **Deep Learning** by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville: This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of deep learning.
*   **The Simulation Hypothesis** by Rizwan Virk: This book explores the idea that our reality might be a sophisticated computer simulation.

## Prompts

*   **SimToM Prompting:** A two-stage prompting technique that enhances the Theory of Mind in LLMs by filtering context based on what a character knows and then answering questions from that character's perspective.
